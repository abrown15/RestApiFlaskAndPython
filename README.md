# RestApiFlaskAndPython
This is my first time using GitHub and I've committed...         


                    ;-)         
                    
                    
                    
...to learning it alongside a course I'm taking on Rest API's using Flask and Python.
The Course can be found here->       https://www.udemy.com/rest-api-flask-and-python/

I'll be adding new files as my course progresses, and am primarily using this as a 
learning tool
